            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9-inch square baking pan with
                aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Slice attached rolls in half widthwise with a serrated knife, keeping rolls connected,
                into a bottom and top slab. Place bottom slab in the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Layer about half the ham evenly over the bottom slab of rolls. Layer Swiss cheese evenly
                on top, and arrange remaining ham over the cheese. Cover with the top slab.</li>
            <li>Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until melted, about 1 minute.
                Add mustard, poppy seeds, Worcestershire sauce, onion, salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Pour butter mixture evenly and slowly over the rolls. Spread over the tops using a spatula; 
                some of the mixture will pool at the base of the rolls. cover with aluminum foil and let
                stand at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, about 20 minutes. Uncover and continue
                baking until browned as desired, 3 to 5 minutes more. Slice into individual sliders.</li>
        </ol>
